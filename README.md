A [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) plugin allowing non-moderators to "reject" topics. "Rejected" topics are 
immediately unlisted, and then are deleted after an hour. 

### Required Configuration

* In category settings for the chosen categor(ies), "enable reject button"
* In site settings, specify "curation helper enabled on topics of users with primary group"

### Notes

Note that Discourse must be restarted in order for the buttons to appear.
If you can help improve this behaviour, PRs are welcome.
